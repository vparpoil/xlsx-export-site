# Overview

Generating Excel files with formatting is always a pain. This API allows any developper to generate Excel files with
formatting in a few lines of code.

With this API you can have : colors, conditional formating (enabling having icons in cells), merged cells etc.

Here is a **real-life example** of what can be done with this API

We have been using this API for years in production and it is very reliable. We are happy to make it available to all
developers from now on.

To integrate a specific Excel export, steps are simple:

- create a template
- generate JSON data from your app
- call the API and retrieve the generated Excel file
