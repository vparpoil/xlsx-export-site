# Host the Template

Once your template file ready, you have two options :

- self-host the template file on any public URL
- use the API dashboard to upload the template file and make it available to the API

## Self-host the template file

To host the template file, you can upload it to any public destination that can be accessed by a public URL. AWS S3
bucket, Cloud storage, Github, your own server, etc.

**Using this option, your template is publicly available on the internet.**

## Use the API dashboard to upload the template file

:::danger Warning

This is not working yet. We are working on it.

After creating an account on the [API dashboard](https://api.jsontoxlsx.com/), you are able to upload template files.

**Using this option, your template is private**, only accessible by the API to generate Excel files.
